# Privacy Policy for GhostPad

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025

## Overview

GhostPad is a privacy-first, offline-focused text editor. We believe your notes are yours alone.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

GhostPad:
- ❌ Does NOT collect personal information
- ❌ Does NOT use analytics or tracking
- ❌ Does NOT require account creation
- ❌ Does NOT send your files anywhere
- ❌ Does NOT use cookies or tracking technologies

## What Data Stays on Your Device

The following data is stored **locally on your computer only**:

1. **Your Files**: Any files you create or edit remain on your local file system
2. **App Preferences**: Settings like dark mode preference are stored in local browser storage
3. **Window Position**: Window size and position (if implemented) are stored locally

This data never leaves your device.

## Network Activity

GhostPad makes **one optional network request**:

- **Update Check**: When you open the app, it checks GitHub's public API for new versions
  - URL: `https://api.github.com/repos/yahitscara/ghostpad/releases/latest`
  - Data sent: None (just a standard HTTP request)
  - Purpose: To notify you when updates are available

This request does not contain any personal information or telemetry.

## Third-Party Services

GhostPad does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Security

Since GhostPad doesn't collect or transmit data, there's no data to secure beyond what's on your own computer. Your files are only as secure as your local file system.

## Children's Privacy

GhostPad does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Open Source

GhostPad is open source software. You can review the complete source code at:

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how GhostPad handles data, we will update this policy and the "Last Updated" date above. Significant changes will be announced in release notes.

**TL;DR**: GhostPad doesn't collect, store, or share any of your data. Everything stays on your computer. We only check GitHub for app updates (no personal data sent).
